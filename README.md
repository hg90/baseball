This is Python code for a machine learning project to predict the winners of baseball games. We used several very large datasets with dozens of features. This was done for the Machine Learning and Computational Statistics course at NYU. 

-Established naive baseline algorithms against which to compare more sophisticated ML models. 
-Used Brier score as the main metric, in addition to ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and accuracy. 
-Python's "Voting Classifer" from sklearn outperformed all other algorithms (including random forest, logistic regression, etc.).
